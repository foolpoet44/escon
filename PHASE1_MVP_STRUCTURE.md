# Phase 1 MVP Frontend Skeleton

Deliverables:
- Project structure (folders/files) in text diagram
- Minimal React + Next.js scaffold with TypeScript
- Core components: Dashboard, SkillExplorer, DomainPage
- Basic routing and run/dev commands
- Theme system outline (dark/light, domain colors)
- Data binding plan to load physical_ai_ontology.json
- Phase 1 milestones with success criteria

Assumptions:
- Ontology JSON located at repo root: physical_ai_ontology.json
- ontology_explorer.html remains as reference; MVP should supersede it
